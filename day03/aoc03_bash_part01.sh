I have sore eyes because I forgot to blink during the\n\tcountless hours I've spent trying to get this to work. Hell, I don't\n\teven know what I've done. But a combination of Excel, internet,\n\tmiddle-school-grade mathematic understanding, a great Spotify\n\tplaylist and lack of social life led me here. I'm done with this\n\tpart of the problem, and I won't even look at part 2. At least not now.\n\tBecause I'm fucking tired. So the mere fact that you just omit input\n\tto this script, it... it... it just baffles me. How do you even have\n\tthe nerve to just \"let's see what happens if I run this, rofl idk lol\"?\n\tYou know what, if you don't have the common courtesy to enter some\n\tinput, you're not worthy of using this script. And thus, it'll exit now.\n\n\tNah, just kidding.\n\n\n\tusage: $(basename "$0") [INPUT] (like digits for example)\n\n"
